I am currently enrolled as a student at the HZ University of Applied Sciences, pursuing an undergraduate degree. I am majoring in Water Management (specialization: Aquatic Ecotechnology) and obtained my minor in Geo-Information from Wageningen University & Research. I am interested in the field of Earth Observation and am seeking exciting internship opportunities related to the same.

My personal interest is to combine the best of both fields to develop water quality and flood monitoring systems for coastal and estuarine regions.
