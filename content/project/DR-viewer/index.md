The second major project I worked on during my time at Deltares, was a webviewer for the department of Infrastructure from the Dominican Republic. The department wanted to visualize 300+ different shapefiles related to climate change impacts on different types of infrastructure within the country. The perfect solution; A webviewer with all the different files.

During this project I was responsible for connecting and visualizing all datasets in GeoServer according to the wishes of the client. I had to make sure each layer was in the correct category with the associated styling attached.

Unfortunately, I am not able to share the results of this project.
